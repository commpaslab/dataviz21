<h3>R practice: playing with legos!</h3>
<p>Download the <a href="../ps/ps1.R">ps1.R</a> script and name it: lastname_ps1.R. Complete the tasks as described in the script and save. You’ll submit the completed script to me on slack (via direct message). I should be able to run the script as is (line by line) with no errors.</p>

<h3>Find data</h3>
<p>Identify a data source you’d like to use for the final visualization. I’ve provided <a href="../resources/">links to a variety of sources</a> to help you out. The data can be anything that interests you!</p>
<p>Part of each week’s work will be using the chosen data set. To make our exchanges around this individual work easier, create a folder that contains the chosen data, an .Rproj file, and the weekly scripts you create using the data. You’ll zip this up and share it with me so that I can follow/review your work.</p>
<p>For the first week, create a script that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reads in the data</li>
<li>Examines the data using some of the functions in PS 1, Question 2</li>
<li>Via comments (#), notes the likely key variables of interest</li>
<li>Via comments, notes any initial issues you see with the data – formats you’ll need to fix, variables you’ll need to derive, possible limitations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your comments don’t need to foreshadow everything; just start getting familiar with the data set and be thinking about some possible questions you might ask of it.</p>
