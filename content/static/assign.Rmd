## Problem Set 2

Due 10/26, by the start of class.

### R practice: Birthdays
This week, you'll use birth dates data collected by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births). Have a look at the linked GitHub page so you understand what variables are included.

Download the [ps2.R](../ps/ps2.R) script and name it: lastname_ps2.R. Complete the tasks as described in the script and save. You'll submit the completed script to me on slack (via direct message). I should be able to run the script as is (line by line) with no errors.

### Your Data
Last week you identified a data set to work with for the final project and began to examine it. Add a new script to your project folder that 

1. Select two key variables you expect to be useful in the final visualization (you identified some key variables last week, but feel free to revise or update). Do either of these variables require additional cleaning/preparation (e.g., reformatting, filtering, recoding, re-leveling factors, mutating, etc.)? If so, add code to begin that cleaning. Either way, there should be some commands that I can follow to see how you checked that these two variables were structured in a reasonable way.
2. Visualize the (univariate) distribution of these two variables in at least two different ways. Practice adding titles (and subtitles or captions), axis labels, legend titles, etc.

Share this new script with me on slack. It should be written so that I can add it to the project folder you shared with me last week and run it.

### Bad Data Visualizations
Thinking about Cairo's criteria for good data visualization (truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, enlightenting) and/or Healey's negative criteria (aesthetics/bad taste, substantive/bad data, perception/bad perception), **find a data visualization you think is especially "bad"** and post it to the slack channel "goodviz-badviz" with a brief explanation of how you think it serves as an example of a poor data visualization (this is a chance to learn from one another).

## Problem Set 1

Due 10/19, by the start of class.

### R practice: playing with legos!
Download the [ps1.R](../ps/ps1.R) script and name it: lastname_ps1.R. Complete the tasks as described in the script and save. You'll submit the completed script to me on slack (via direct message). I should be able to run the script as is (line by line) with no errors.

### Find data
Identify a data source you'd like to use for the final visualization. I've provided [links to a variety of sources](../resources/) to help you out. The data can be anything that interests you! 

Part of each week's work will be using the chosen data set. To make our exchanges around this individual work easier, create a folder that contains the chosen data, an .Rproj file, and the weekly scripts you create using the data. You'll zip this up and share it with me so that I can follow/review your work.

For the first week, create a script that

1. Reads in the data
2. Examines the data using some of the functions in PS 1, Question 2
3. Via comments (#), note the likely key variables of interest

Your comments don't need to foreshadow everything; just start getting familiar with the data set and be thinking about some possible questions you might ask of it.
